## About

This program is created by the Wear Your 255.255.255.0 team at Hack-in-Place Hackathon, hosted by A2CN.

## Problem Addressed

- Small businesses usually have a lot to manage, and without access to manpower, rely significantly on infrastructure and tools to help.

- Due to the sudden change from Covid, businesses have been thrust into a chaotic situation with several moving parts without the tools that would usually be in place to assist them, putting them into situations that they aren't experienced in handling.

## Solution

- Our solution keeps all Covid related information available in a single location to assist SBO in managing the Covid related aspects of their business.

- This would allow SBO to manage businesses like they usually would before Covid, and focus on what matters to them.
